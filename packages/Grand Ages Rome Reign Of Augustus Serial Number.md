However, some players have reported a problem with the serial number of the expansion pack. After installing the game, they are asked to enter a CD-key, but none of the keys provided by Steam or other sources seem to work. They get an error message saying "The Serial number is Wrong". This prevents them from playing the game and enjoying its content.
  
So, how can you fix this issue and play Grand Ages: Rome - Reign of Augustus without any hassle? Here are some possible solutions that might work for you:
  
- Check your Caps Lock. Make sure you enter the CD-key exactly as it is shown, with uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Use the CD-key of the expansion pack, not the base game. Some players have mistakenly used the key of Grand Ages: Rome instead of Grand Ages: Rome - Reign of Augustus. You need to use the latter to activate the expansion pack.
- Enter the CD-key without hyphens. According to some players who managed to solve the issue[^1^], you need to enter the CD-key without any dashes or spaces. For example, if your key is "ABCD-EFGH-IJKL-MNOP-QRST", just enter it as "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST". This might trick the game into accepting the key.
- Contact Kalypso support. If none of the above methods work for you, you might need to contact the publisher of the game, Kalypso Media, and ask for their help. You can email them at support@kaylpsomedia.com and explain your problem. They might be able to provide you with a new key or a workaround.
