Chaturmas is derived from the Sanskrit words chatur, meaning four, and masa, meaning month. It refers to the period of four months from the eleventh day of the bright half of Ashadha to the eleventh day of the bright half of Kartik, according to the Hindu lunar calendar. This period coincides with the rainy season in India, when the movement and travel of people are restricted due to the heavy rains and floods. Therefore, many Hindu sages and saints choose this time to stay in one place and engage in intense meditation and penance. They also observe various vows and fasts to purify their minds and bodies and to attain spiritual enlightenment.

Chaturmas is also considered as a favorable time for the devotees to worship various forms of God and Goddesses, such as Lord Vishnu, Lord Shiva, Lord Ganesha, Goddess Lakshmi, Goddess Durga, and Goddess Saraswati. Each month of Chaturmas has its own significance and importance, and different deities are honored and celebrated in each month. For example, Shravan is dedicated to Lord Shiva, Bhadrapad to Lord Ganesha, Ashwin to Goddess Durga, and Kartik to Lord Vishnu. The devotees perform various rituals and ceremonies, such as abhishekam, puja, aarti, bhajan, kirtan, prasad, etc., to please their favorite deities and to seek their blessings.
 
Chaturmas is also a time for the devotees to practice self-restraint and discipline in their daily lives. They abstain from eating certain foods, such as onion, garlic, grains, pulses, leafy vegetables, etc., that are believed to stimulate passion and anger. They also avoid indulging in sensual pleasures and worldly activities that distract them from their spiritual goals. They follow a simple and austere lifestyle that helps them to detach themselves from the material world and focus on their inner self. They also perform charitable deeds and acts of kindness towards others, especially the poor and needy. They share their food, clothes, money, etc., with those who are less fortunate than them. They also respect and honor all living beings as manifestations of God.
