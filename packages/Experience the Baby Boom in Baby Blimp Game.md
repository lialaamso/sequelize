## How to Play Baby Blimp Game
 
Baby Blimp Game is easy to play but hard to master. You will need to use your mouse to click and drag the items and the storks. You will also need to pay attention to the icons and the timers that indicate the babies' needs and the parents' patience.
 
The game has two modes: Story Mode and Survival Mode. In Story Mode, you will follow the map and complete different objectives in each level. You will also unlock new upgrades and bonuses as you progress. In Survival Mode, you will try to make and deliver as many babies as possible without losing any points.
 
Here are some tips and tricks to help you play Baby Blimp Game:
 
- Make sure to match the gender of the baby with the slot machine and the house. If you make a mistake, you can use the trash can to discard the baby.
- Prepare some bottles in advance and keep them in the fridge. You can also upgrade the fridge to store more bottles.
- Use the bonuses wisely. Twins and quadruplets will give you more points and save you time, but they will also take up more space in your blimp.
- Watch out for the weather and the anti-stork neighbours. Equip your storks with hats and avoid flying over hostile houses.
- Try to make combos by delivering multiple babies of the same gender or colour in a row. This will increase your score and your rank.
