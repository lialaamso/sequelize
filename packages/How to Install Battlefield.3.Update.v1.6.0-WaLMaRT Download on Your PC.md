If you want to download and install the Battlefield 3 Update v1.6.0-WaLMaRT, you will need to have the base game installed on your PC, as well as the previous updates up to v1.5.0. You will also need to have a torrent client such as uTorrent or BitTorrent to download the update file from the WaLMaRT website or other sources. The update file is about 4 GB in size and contains an executable file that will automatically patch your game to the latest version.
 
However, before you download and install the update, you should be aware of the risks and consequences of using a cracked version of Battlefield 3. First of all, you will not be able to play online with other players who have the official version of the game or access any of the official servers or services.

Second of all, you may expose your PC to malware or viruses that may be hidden in the update file or in the unofficial servers. You may also face legal action from Electronic Arts or other authorities for violating their terms of service or intellectual property rights.
